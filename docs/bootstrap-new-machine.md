# Bootstrapping a new machine

The whole environment comes up from **one command** on any machine that can reach
your Gitea. This is what makes the setup portable.

## One-liner

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply https://gitea.stump.rocks/joestump/dotfiles.git
```

That command:

1. downloads and runs `chezmoi` (no prior install needed),
2. clones the private dotfiles repo into `~/.local/share/chezmoi`,
3. runs the `run_once_before_` bootstrap (below),
4. clones externals (themes + external plugins) per `.chezmoiexternal.toml`,
5. writes `~/.zshrc` and `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/*`,
6. runs the `run_once_after_` hook wiring.

You'll be prompted once for Gitea credentials (HTTPS). On macOS they're cached in
the login keychain thereafter.

## What the bootstrap does

`run_once_before_10-install-prereqs.sh` (runs once per machine, before any file
is written — every step is idempotent):

- installs **Homebrew** if missing,
- `brew install chezmoi direnv gitleaks fzf zoxide` (+ the `vault` CLI from
  `hashicorp/tap` — the OpenBao-compatible client),
- installs **Oh My Zsh** if `~/.oh-my-zsh` is absent, using
  `RUNZSH=no KEEP_ZSHRC=yes` so it **never** overwrites the chezmoi-managed
  `~/.zshrc`.

`run_once_after_20-configure-git-hooks.sh` sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks` in the
freshly-cloned source repo (git clone doesn't carry that local config), wiring the
gitleaks pre-commit hook.

## After first apply

1. **Set the terminal font** to a Nerd Font for the Spaceship/Powerlevel10k icons:
   ```sh
   brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
   ```
   then select it in your terminal profile.
2. **Authenticate OpenBao and start the Vault Agent** so secrets render:
   ```sh
   export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.stump.rocks
   vault login -method=oidc      # seeds ~/.vault-token (the agent reads + renews it)
   vault-agent start             # launchd job renders ~/.config/vault/secrets-*.env
   ```
   (Static KV + the AWS engine already exist server-side — no re-setup.) See
   [docs/secrets.md](secrets.md).
3. Open a new shell (`exec zsh`).

## Updating an existing machine

```sh
chezmoi update                       # pull repo + apply
chezmoi apply --refresh-externals    # also re-pull theme/plugin upstreams
```

## What enables the portability (summary)

| Capability | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| One-command install | `chezmoi init --apply <repo>` |
| Install tools + OMZ on a bare machine | `run_once_before_` script |
| "My own OMZ ecosystem" (themes, external plugins) | `.chezmoiexternal.toml` git-repo externals |
| Reproducible repo-local git hooks | `run_once_after_` + `core.hooksPath` |
| Secrets that travel without being committed | OpenBao + Vault Agent (see [secrets.md](secrets.md)) |
